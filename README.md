# Self-RAG Sports Betting

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description  
Self-RAG Sports Betting is an AI-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system designed to answer sports betting queries efficiently. It routes user questions to either:  
- **A vector database** for retrieving relevant information.  
- **A web search** when the data isn't available in the knowledge base.  

By combining retrieval and generation, the system provides accurate and up-to-date betting insights.
